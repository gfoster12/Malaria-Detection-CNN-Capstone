# 🦠 Malaria Detection from Blood Cell Images using CNN

This project uses a CNN model to detect malaria from 64x64 blood cell images. It supports faster and more standardized diagnosis using computer vision and deep learning.

## 📊 Overview
- **Model**: VGG16 (transfer learning)
- **Data**: NIH Malaria Dataset
- **Goal**: Classify images as Parasitized or Uninfected

## 📁 Structure
- `notebooks/`: Capstone notebook
- `data/cell_images/`: Raw image dataset
- `src/`: Python modules (training, evaluation)
- `models/`: Output model files
- `images/`: Visualizations

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Run the notebook:
```bash
open notebooks/Capstone_Malaria_Detection.html
```
